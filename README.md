# Customer Churn Prediction

Customer Churn Prediction is the use of data and predictive analytics to foresee which customers are likely to leave, enabling businesses to take preventive actions and enhance customer retention.

## Notebook Content

### AutoSearch Vs NN

This repository contains notebooks that explore two different approaches for customer churn prediction: AutoSearch (an automated model selection and tuning approach) and a Neural Network (NN) model.

- [1.0- Load Data and Imports](#10-load-data-and-imports)
    - [1.1- Import required libraries](#11-import-required-libraries)

    In this section, we begin by loading the necessary data and importing the required Python libraries to perform customer churn prediction.

- [2.0- EDA](#20-eda)
    - [2.1- Illustrate the correlation or connection between different columns in the dataset](#21-illustrate-the-correlation-or-connection-between-different-columns-in-the-dataset)

    Explore the dataset and illustrate the correlation and connections between different columns. Understanding the data is crucial for building an effective churn prediction model.

- [3.0- Preprocessing Data and Load Model](#30-preprocessing-data-and-load-model)
    - [3.1- Preprocessing](#31-preprocessing)
    - [3.2- AutoSearch model](#32-autosearch-model)
    - [3.3- Make Prediction](#33-make-prediction)

    In this section, we preprocess the data to prepare it for model training and evaluation.

    - **3.1- Preprocessing**: Prepare the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

    - **3.2- AutoSearch model**: Utilize an AutoSearch model for customer churn prediction. AutoSearch automates the process of model selection and hyperparameter tuning, making it easier to find the best model for the task.

    - **3.3- Make Prediction**: Generate predictions using the AutoSearch model to identify potential customer churn.

- [4.0- NN Model](#40-nn-model)
    - [4.1- Prepare the Data](#41-prepare-the-data)
    - [4.2- Create Neural Network Model](#42-create-neural-network-model)
    - [4.3- Make Prediction](#43-make-prediction)

    In this section, we explore a Neural Network (NN) model for customer churn prediction.

    - **4.1- Prepare the Data**: Prepare the data for training the Neural Network model, including data splitting and feature scaling.

    - **4.2- Create Neural Network Model**: Design and build a Neural Network model specifically tailored for customer churn prediction.

    - **4.3- Make Prediction**: Use the Neural Network model to make predictions and assess customer churn likelihood.
